/**
 * Structural test — KB bundle isolation
 *
 * Asserts that KB hooks AND upstream service files do NOT contain bare
 * top-level static imports of knowledgeBankService or storageService.
 *
 * Static imports pull the entire KB service tree into the initial bundle
 * even though KnowledgeBankPanel is lazy-loaded in Layout.tsx, defeating
 * Rollup's code-splitting for the KB feature chunk.
 *
 * Each call-site must use `await import(...)` inline so Rollup can defer
 * the KB service tree to a separate lazy chunk.
 *
 * See: mydocs/DEVTOOLS-146-ADOPTION-PLAN.md — Phase 1
